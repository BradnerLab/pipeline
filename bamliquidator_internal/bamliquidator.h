/** 
 * Count the number of reads in a chromosome between start and stop.  This function 
 * is thread safe.  This function throws if an error is encountered opening or parsing
 * the bamfile with samtools.
 *
 * @param bamfile   the path of the bamfile (which is opened readonly),
 *                  e.g. "../tmp/04032013_D1L57ACXX_4.TTAGGC.hg18.bwt.sorted.bam" 
 * @param chromsome the chromosome to count on, e.g. "chr1" or "chrX" 
 * @param start     the first base pair index to count on (inclusive), e.g. 0 to start 
                    at the beginning   
 * @param stop      the last base pair index to count on (exclusive), e.g. 247249719
 * @param strand    '+' for the forward strand, '-' for the reverse strand, and '.' for both
 * @param spnum     number of summary points, e.g. if 4 with start of 0 and stop of 99,
                    the returned vector will have four counts, the first for the range
                    [0, 24], the second for [25, 49], third for [50, 74], and the last for 
                    [75, 99] -- use 1 for a single summary point
 * @param extenlen  extension length, e.g. 0 is usually used
 * 
 * @return the read counts for the range [start, stop], split into spnum pieces
